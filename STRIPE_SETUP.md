   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: https://your-domain.vercel.app (or your custom domain)

## 3. How the Integration Works

### Cart to Stripe Product Mapping
1. **Product Matching**: The system matches cart items to Stripe products by name
2. **Fallback**: If no matching Stripe product is found, it creates a dynamic product
3. **Pricing**: Uses Stripe product prices when available, otherwise uses cart prices

### Payment Flow
1. User adds products to cart (HomePage)
2. User proceeds to checkout (CheckoutPage)
3. User clicks "Complete Purchase"
4. System creates Stripe checkout session with cart items
5. User is redirected to Stripe checkout
6. After payment, user is redirected to success page

## 4. Testing

### Test Cards
Use these test cards for testing:
- **Success**: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **Decline**: 4000 0000 0000 0002
- **Requires Authentication**: 4000 0025 0000 3155

### Test Mode vs Live Mode
- **Current Setup**: Live mode (real payments)
- **For Testing**: Consider switching to test mode first
- **Test Keys**: Replace with test keys for development
